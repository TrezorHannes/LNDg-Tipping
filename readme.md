Many blocks ago, a small new tool was teased in the Plebnet channel. It was a time when I spend many blocks trying to get my Lightning Node channels balanced, or a quick glance at flows and fees. While the benefit was a lot of learning taking in, it took a lot of time.

Many noderunners today face the same challenges. Running a node, especially if deemed to be profitable, requires constant fiddling and handholding (we heard the reference of a *Tamagotchi*‚Ñ¢).

So this new tool didn't get a lot of traction first. We've all been to busy managing our nodes. And it looked kind of quirky. But little did we know, that it'd make *node-running from the hammock*‚Ñ¢ a possibility. 

But then it gained traction. Runners been suspicious. It made rebalancing easier, but it requires access to your admin.macaroon. It can manage your fees. It'll record your flows. 

### **[LNDg](https://github.com/cryptosharks131/lndg) was taking over our nodes, and it did this spendidly to this day**.

This story is about showing appreciation to the fearless and tireless who continue to make it better every day. And if you gathered benefits from using LNDg today or tomorrow, we - a bunch of thankful noderunners - want to provide **YOU** the option to share your gratitude.

### Three options to keep it simple, chose any of the below you prefer

 - Give them a [![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/cryptosharks131.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40Crypto%20Sharks)](https://twitter.com/cryptosharks131) and say thank you. Today.
 - Star ‚≠ê [the repository on Github](https://github.com/cryptosharks131/lndg). It's like mana for a developer
 - Got a few Satoshis to spare? Either head over [to our donation page](https://pwbtc.duckdns.org/tipjar/7)[^1], we have handed over the LNBits-wallet to @NguTechnologies, so s/he pull from there anytime, or with his / her [LNtxbot](https://lntxbot.com/@ngutechnologies).

And the fourth one is a bonus: Share this page whenever you see anyone having a better node-running day because of **LNDg**.

NguTechnologies: Thank you, on behalf of the plebnet ‚ö° community. üß°üß°üß°
